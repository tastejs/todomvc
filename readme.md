Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV\* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.

Backbone, Ember, AngularJS... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?

To help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV\* frameworks of today.


## Team

TodoMVC would not be possible without a strong team of [contributors](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/contributors) helping push the project forward each day. Additionally, we have a core project team composed of:

## Disclaimer

<img align="right" width="230" height="230" src="media/icon-small.png">

TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV\* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project can offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of a framework's potential capability.

It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured, and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.

Also, please keep in mind that TodoMVC is not the perfect way to compare the size of different frameworks. We intentionally use the unminified versions to make reading the source code easier.


## Getting Involved

Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.
