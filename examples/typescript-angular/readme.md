# TypeScript & AngularJS TodoMVC Example

> TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open Source.

## Implementation

[TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) is a superset of JavaScript, with optional type annotations. As any JS is valid TS, there is no interoperability issue. You could slowly convert an existing JS code-base and use JS libraries natively. You already know most of the language. It compiles back to JS.

It's attractive to people with a background in strongly typed languages, who are willing to type in more code-- classes and type annotations-- receiving the benefit of type checking on compile time. IntelliSense works better, as well.


### Editors
A great editor for TypeScript is Visual Studio 2012 with [TypeScript](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=266563) and  [Web Essentials 2012](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6) plugins.

Webstorm has [support for TypeScript](http://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2013/11/enjoy-typescript-in-webstorm/) as well.


### Ambient declarations

It is useful to have type information for the libraries you use. [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped) is a nice collection of annotations by Boris Yankov.


### Files

* `*.ts` are source code files.
* `*.d.ts` are ambient declarations for libraries.
* `*.js` are generated by the compiler, except in the `js/libs` folder.
* `*.js.map` are [source maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) generated by the compiler, for better debugging experience.
* `_all.ts` is a convention used to enumerate file references in the project for the benefit of the TypeScript compiler.

If the number of files grows, you could put an `_all.ts` file into each folder, move all nested references to it and reference the nested `_all.ts` from the parent `_all.ts`.

Start reading `TodoCtrl.ts` first, continue with `Application.ts` and `index.html`, then the rest of it is easy.


### AngularJS

There is very little difference between this app and the vanilla AngularJS todo app in how AngularJS is used.
The only significant difference is that dependency injection is done via annotated constructors, which allows minification of JavaScript.

It's definitely possible to convert the vanillajs todo app into TypeScript, but TypeScript's benefits are more obvious with a full blown framework and project structure.


## Running

A standalone TypeScript compiler is available on NPM.

	npm install

To compile the TypeScript in this project:

	# from examples/typescript-angular
	run `npm run compile`

<br />
## Visual Studio 2015 RC

There is no VS template for client-side only apps but the following should get this example running.

>Create a new ASP.NET Web Application solution and choose **empty "ASP.NET 5 Preview Template"**.

>**Uncheck** "Create directory for solution" .   

This will create some server side code but will also add support for client side packages **npm, bower** etc.   Select the solution and **"save as..."** in the same folder as the project.      

Close the Visual Studio solution.

<br />
Use notepad to delete the following 2 lines from the **.xproj** otherwise VS will keep creating an unused folder called "artifacts" above this folder.

    <BaseIntermediateOutputPath Condition="'$(BaseIntermediateOutputPath)'=='' ">artifacts\obj\$(MSBuildProjectName)</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>
    <OutputPath Condition="'$(OutputPath)'=='' ">artifacts\bin\$(MSBuildProjectName)\</OutputPath>


[Download the whole todomvc repo to a temporary folder](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/archive/master.zip)

Copy the entire contents of todomvc-master.zip/todomvc-master/examples/typescript-angular into your project folder.

 In Windows Explorer:

>Move the **js** folder into **wwwroot**.

>Move **index.html** into **wwwroot**

>**Copy** the **node_modules** folder into **wwwroot**

<br />
Reopen the Visual Studio solution.   You'll get a dialog saying "Your project has been configured to support TypeScript" and offering you info on Grunt and Gulp.   You can reply Yes or No.

>Delete the following lines from **startup.cs**

            app.Run(async (context) =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
            });

Press F5 to start the app in your browser.   You can set breakpoints in your TypeScript files.   Before you try to compile the typescript files you will need to set up Gulp or Grunt.

>**TODO Set up Gulp for TypeScript**

>**TODO Upgrade to TypeScript 1.5.0**
