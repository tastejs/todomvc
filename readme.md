## Helping you select an MV\* framework


Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV\* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps.

Backbone, Ember, AngularJS, Spine... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?

To help solve this problem, we created TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using MV* concepts in most of the popular JavaScript MV\* frameworks of today.


#### Todo apps are included for:

- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)
- [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com)
- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
- [Spine](http://spinejs.com)
- [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com) (MVVM)
- [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org)
- [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com)
- [Batman.js](http://batmanjs.org)
- [Closure](http://code.google.com/closure/library/)
- [Agility.js](http://agilityjs.com)
- [Knockback.js](http://kmalakoff.github.com/knockback)
- [Google Web Toolkit](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/)


###### Non MV*

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
- Vanilla JS

###### RequireJS

- [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) + [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) (using AMD)

## Team

TodoMVC would not be possible without a strong team of [contributors](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/contributors) helping push the project forward each day. In addition, we have a core project team composed of:

#### [Addy Osmani](http://github.com/addyosmani) - Founder/Lead

Addy is a Developer Platform Engineer at Google who originally created TodoMVC. He oversees the project direction, drives expansion and helps lead core development with Sindre Sorhus (by far our most active contributor!).

## Disclaimer

TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.

It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.


## Project Status

TodoMVC 1.0 includes re-writes of almost all applications, ensuring they follow a consistent set of specifications and are using the latest versions of all libraries and frameworks in use. We've also addressed framework author concerns about routing by adding this to many of the more mainstream applications in the project.


## Getting Involved

Whilst we enjoy implementing and improving existing Todo apps, we're always interested in speaking to framework authors (and users) wishing to share Todo app implementations in their framework/solution of choice.

Check out our [contribution docs](todomvc/blob/gh-pages/contributing.md) for more info.
