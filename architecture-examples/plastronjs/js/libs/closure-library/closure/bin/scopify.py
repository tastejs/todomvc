"""Automatically converts codebases over to goog.scope.

Usage:
cd path/to/my/dir;
../../../../javascript/closure/bin/scopify.py

Scans every file in this directory, recursively. Looks for existing
goog.scope calls, and goog.require'd symbols. If it makes sense to
generate a goog.scope call for the file, then we will do so, and
try to auto-generate some aliases based on the goog.require'd symbols.

Known Issues:

  When a file is goog.scope'd, the file contents will be indented +2.
  This may put some lines over 80 chars. These will need to be fixed manually.

  We will only try to create aliases for capitalized names. We do not check
  to see if those names will conflict with any existing locals.

  This creates merge conflicts for every line of every outstanding change.
  If you intend to run this on your codebase, make sure your team members
  know. Better yet, send them this script so that they can scopify their
  outstanding changes and "accept theirs".

  When an alias is "captured", it can no longer be stubbed out for testing.
  Run your tests.
