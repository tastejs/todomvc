`app-route-converter` provides a means to convert a path and query
parameters into a route object and vice versa. This produced route object
is to be fed into route-consuming elements such as `app-route`.

> n.b. This element is intended to be a primitive of the routing system and for
creating bespoke routing solutions from scratch. To simply include routing in
an app, please refer to [app-location](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-route/blob/master/app-location.html)
and [app-route](https://github.com/PolymerElements/app-route/blob/master/app-route.html).

An example of a route object that describes
`https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-route-converter?foo=bar&baz=qux`
and should be passed to other `app-route` elements:

    {
      prefix: '',
      path: '/elements/app-route-converter',
      __queryParams: {
        foo: 'bar',
        baz: 'qux'
      }
    }

`__queryParams` is private to discourage directly data-binding to it. This is so
that routing elements like `app-route` can intermediate changes to the query
params and choose whether to propagate them upstream or not. `app-route` for
example will not propagate changes to its `queryParams` property if it is not
currently active. A public queryParams object will also be produced in which you
should perform data-binding operations.

Example Usage:

    <iron-location path="{{path}}" query="{{query}}"></iron-location>
    <iron-query-params
        params-string="{{query}}"
        params-object="{{queryParams}}">
    </iron-query-params>
    <app-route-converter
        path="{{path}}"
        query-params="{{queryParams}}"
        route="{{route}}">
    </app-route-converter>
    <app-route route='{{route}}' pattern='/:page' data='{{data}}'>
    </app-route>

This is a simplified implementation of the `app-location` element. Here the
`iron-location` produces a path and a query, the `iron-query-params` consumes
the query and produces a queryParams object, and the `app-route-converter`
consumes the path and the query params and converts it into a route which is in
turn is consumed by the `app-route`.
