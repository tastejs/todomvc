#### Components <i class="material-icons mdl-color-text--grey-500">extension</i>

Exception made for handling of standard events and behaviors,
a [view template](#/docs#Getting_Started--View_Templates) cannot implement a more complex UI logic.

This is where *components* come in handy. In addition to all the features of
a view template, a component has a piece of *JavaScript* code associated
to it and may so control any element in its view, make service calls and
implement any kind of complex UI functionality.

This piece of JavaScript code is the **Controller** of the component.


##### Loading a component

To load a component the `data-ui-load` attribute is used in the same way
described for `data-ui-include` attribute in [content loading](#/docs#Getting_Started--Content_Loading),
so also the `data-ui-options` attribute may be used to provide options
such as *lazy loading* and *data binding*.

<small><strong>EXAMPLE - HTML</strong> Loading a component</small>
<pre><code class="language-html">
    <div data-ui-load="widgets/timeclock"></div>
</code></pre>

<small><strong>RESULT</strong></small>

<div data-ui-load="widgets/timeclock" class="animated zoomIn"></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

When loading a component *zUIx* will first try to get the **controller** script,
then the **view** and finally the **style**, any of which can be defined either
inline or in a file.

The example above is defined by the following files:
<div class="list" markdown="1">
- [timeclock.html](https://github.com/genielabs/zuix/blob/gh-pages/source/app/widgets/timeclock.html)
- [timeclock.css](https://github.com/genielabs/zuix/blob/gh-pages/source/app/widgets/timeclock.css)
- [timeclock.js](https://github.com/genielabs/zuix/blob/gh-pages/source/app/widgets/timeclock.js)
</div>


##### The Controller

When all elements of a component are loaded (js controller, html view, css style)
the controller method `create()` is called.
When otherwise a component is requested to unload, the `destroy()`
method is called.

The following snippet is the skeleton of a controller declaration.

<small><strong>EXAMPLE</strong> Controller declaration</small>
<pre><code class="language-js">
zuix.controller(function(cp) {

    /* private fields */
    // ...

    /* life-cycle handlers declaration */
    cp.init = function() { /* called before component is created and before applying options */ };
    cp.create = function() { /* called after loading, when the component is created */ };
    cp.destroy = function() { /* called when the component is destroyed */ }
    cp.update = function() { /* called each time the data model is updated */ }

    /* private functions */
    // ...

}).for('path/of/component');
</code></pre>

The method call `.for('path/of/component')` is only required when
the controller is defined inline rather than in a separate file.

The `cp` object passed to the controller handler is the
`{ContextController}` object.
Referer to the API page for a complete list of properties and methods
of the [{ContextController}](#/api#ZUIX_API--ContextController) object.
