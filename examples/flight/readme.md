## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need to install additional helpers via bower and npm and
run `npm test` afterwards:

```bash
bower install & npm install
npm test
```

You can also run `karma start` after the dependencies are installed to
automatically watch for changes and re-run the test suite.
