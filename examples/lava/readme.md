# LiquidLava TodoMVC Example

> LiquidLava is an MVC framework for building user interfaces, which scale from simple interactive elements on page to
> complex feature-rich applications. What makes it different from other frameworks is transparent internal design:
> this means, that you always know, what you are doing, and what happens inside the framework.

##Build

There are two index files in this example: "index_raw.html" - the original source,
and "index.html" - bundled version of index_raw.

Bundled version loads faster, although you can launch "index_raw.html" in browser, and it will work as expected.
