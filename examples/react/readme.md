# React TodoMVC Example

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.

To run the app, spin up an HTTP server (e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) and visit http://localhost/.../myexample/.
