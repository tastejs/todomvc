## Building the app

As this application is using node's module system, `browserify` or similar tool is required to package it for the browser. To build the app, simply do:

```
npm run build
```

To automatically rebuild the application as you make changes to the source code, you can do:

```
npm run watch
```

Make sure that you've installed all the dependencies first:

```
npm install
```
