     * Attribute provides configurable attribute support along with attribute change events. It is designed to be 
     * augmented on to a host class, and provides the host with the ability to configure attributes to store and retrieve state, 
     * along with attribute change events.
     * </p>
     * <p>For example, attributes added to the host can be configured:</p>
     * <ul>
     *     <li>As read only.</li>
     *     <li>As write once.</li>
     *     <li>With a setter function, which can be used to manipulate
     *     values passed to Attribute's <a href="#method_set">set</a> method, before they are stored.</li>
     *     <li>With a getter function, which can be used to manipulate stored values,
     *     before they are returned by Attribute's <a href="#method_get">get</a> method.</li>
     *     <li>With a validator function, to validate values before they are stored.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>See the <a href="#method_addAttr">addAttr</a> method, for the complete set of configuration
     * options available for attributes.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Most implementations will be better off extending the <a href="Base.html">Base</a> class, 
     * instead of augmenting Attribute directly. Base augments Attribute and will handle the initial configuration 
     * of attributes for derived classes, accounting for values passed into the constructor.</p>
     *
     * @class Attribute
     * @param attrs {Object} The attributes to add during construction (passed through to <a href="#method_addAttrs">addAttrs</a>). These can also be defined on the constructor being augmented with Attribute by defining the ATTRS property on the constructor.
     * @param values {Object} The initial attribute values to apply (passed through to <a href="#method_addAttrs">addAttrs</a>). These are not merged/cloned. The caller is responsible for isolating user provided values if required.
     * @param lazy {boolean} Whether or not to add attributes lazily (passed through to <a href="#method_addAttrs">addAttrs</a>).
     * @uses AttributeCore
     * @uses AttributeEvents
